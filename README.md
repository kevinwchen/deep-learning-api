# Translation API

This is a web server app that can translate text based on a user input. The input is taken in through a post request, and the result extracted from a database once the translation has finished running.

The API can be accessed either using your own API tool (Postman, Insomnia, etc.) or by going to the /docs page (FastAPI UI).
